          We make loud movies that we could be proud of and we do whatever it
          takes to keep <br /> it so. Founded in 2020 masterminded by the vision
          of Serj Gabyan and inspired by his <br /> 15+ years of media
          production and directing experience. Our creed is <br /> &quot;Do or
          die trying&quot;, no matter how dangerous it may sound.
          <br /> We don&apos;t believe in plan &quot;B&quot;s, and we know it
          works because
          <br /> we&apos;ve done it. We&apos;ve experienced the hell of making
          an <br />
          impressive movie, and we are determined to
          <br /> do it again. So behold, the best is yet to <br />
          come, as it is inevitable because we love
          <br /> what we do. &quot;Hooligun Studios&quot; aims to
          <br /> make buxom movies that will be watched
          <br /> even after 30 years from its release. And we
          <br /> shall take over the hearts of cinema lovers
          <br /> one by one - a movie at a time.
